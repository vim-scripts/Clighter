Clighter(Clang Highlighter) is a c-family semantic highlighting plugin for Vim, based on Clang. Clighter use libclang to enhance c-family source code highlighting from Vim builtin syntax highlighting to semantic highlighting. Clighter doesn't disable the builtin syntax highlighting, but just "append" the semantic highlighting into the code. 

Clighter provides the following features:
Automatically do semantic highlighting for c-family source code.
Automatically mark all words that with the same definition
Options to customize the colors
